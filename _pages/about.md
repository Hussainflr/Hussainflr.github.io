Hello, I’m Muzamil Hussain. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I focused on cutting-edge research in human-robot interaction. With five years of industry experience, I've worked on a range of AI and machine learning projects, from developing AI workout assistants to creating predictive models for autonomous vehicles.

Currently, I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at DBS Bank, where I build scalable solutions that improve model deployment and monitoring. My passion for computer vision led me to publish my research in IEEE ICIP 2020, and I have hands-on experience with frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

In addition to my industry work, I’ve spent three years teaching AI and programming courses to undergraduates. I’m excited to continue exploring innovative AI solutions, especially in the fields of computer vision and medical imaging.
